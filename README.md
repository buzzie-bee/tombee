# Tom Bee Personal Portfolio Site

This is my personal portfolio site. I wanted to create a clean yet functional single page portfolio with examples of my work. This was built using React and Tailwind CSS.

## Running locally

Set up the code using:

`git clone https://github.com/buzzie-bee/tombee`

and

`npm install`

then `npm start`

## Any questions?

Get in touch with me if you have any questions about this. As I've mentioned it's just something I bashed together to make data entry for selecting images a bit better so it's not feature rich, however it's definitely a good enough mvp to let me execute my plan to source images myself.
