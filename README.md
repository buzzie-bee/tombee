# Tom Bee Personal Portfolio Site

This is my personal portfolio site. I wanted to create a clean yet functional single page portfolio with examples of my work. This was built using React and Tailwind CSS.

Hosted with firebase hosting at www.tombee.io

## Running locally

Clone the repo using:

`git clone https://github.com/buzzie-bee/tombee`

and

`npm install`

then `npm start`

## Any questions?

Get in touch with me if you have any questions about this at www.tombee.io
